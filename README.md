# Dual-motor Dual-source High Performance EV: A Comprehen-sive Review 

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) have been regarded as one of the promising alternatives to ze-ro-emission transportation. New EV registrations have increased as a result of government pol-icies and consumers’ awareness of climate change. Besides, EV technology is being improved through ongoing research and development efforts. Among them, a powertrain with a combina-tion of two electric motors has been proposed for high driving and efficiency performance. The study presents a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of architectures and energy distribution for a dual-motor equipped with dual-source EV system. In detail, various dual-motor configurations and energy management strategies (EMSs) used in the literature are investigated and categorized. A comparison of the benefits and drawbacks of existing topologies and the EMSs of hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) is also discussed. Following that, research gaps have been taken into account. This study can be used as a reference for researchers who are interested in the design and optimal control of the dual-motor dual-source EVs.
